Now that we've designed the frontends for:

- Dashboard and all components
- pricing 
- And all other pages

Make a plan to complete the full backend implementation for this app. Refer to @product-overview.md for an overview of functionality that we're going for, Make sure that each plan is seperated into structures.

All buttons, navigation links and functionality should be functional and ready for me to test in a browser.

Ask me clarifying questions to dial in the details for your plan.
