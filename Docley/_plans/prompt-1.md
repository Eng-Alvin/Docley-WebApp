Let's start with the frontend design. We won't build the full API and backend functionality just yet. We'll focus on the design and UI first.

Start by stubbing out routes and views for:

-Landing page
- Pricing
- Blog
- Dashboard
- Guiding students through a clear transformation journey
- Making the “before → after” value obvious
- Minimizing cognitive load
- Emphasizing safety, structure, and readiness
- Rich text editor
- export component

Then use your frontend-design skill to design a clean, professional, frontend design, UI and UX for each of those views.

- use soft gradient in the webapp to make it look and feel good (just minimal)

Requirements:

- All views are mobile responsive and work well on mobile, tablet, desktop and screen sizes.
- All views are light mode only.
- Use TailwindCSS (already installed) utility classes only, don't write custom CSS.
- Use TailwindCSS (already installed) color utility classes, don't use custom colors.
- Use Google Fonts (not installed)
- Use Lucide icons (not installed)

When finished, make sure all the components are properly routed

Start by asking me clarifying questions to inform your plan for this.
