      <p>Every semester, thousands of students lose valuable marks not because their ideas are bad, but because their delivery is flawed. Academic writing is a specific genre with rigid rules, and violating them is the fastest way to lower your GPA.</p>
      
      <h3>1. The "I Think" Syndrome</h3>
      <p>Academic writing should be objective. Phrases like "I think," "I believe," or "In my opinion" weaken your argument. Instead of saying "I think the data shows...", say "The data suggests..." or "Evidence indicates that..."</p>
      
      <h3>2. Colloquial Language</h3>
      <p>Assignments are not text messages. Avoid contractions (don't, can't, won't) and slang. Words like "huge," "awesome," or "crazy" have no place in a research paper. Use "significant," "substantial," or "unprecedented" instead.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Weak Thesis Statements</h3>
      <p>Your thesis is the anchor of your entire paper. A vague thesis like "Climate change is a big problem" gives you no direction. A strong thesis argues a specific point: "Anthropogenic climate change requires immediate legislative intervention to mitigate irreversible economic damage."</p>

      <h3>4. Poor Citation Practices</h3>
      <p>Plagiarism isn't just copying; it's failing to credit sources correctly. If you state a fact that isn't common knowledge, you MUST cite it. When in doubt, cite it out.</p>

      <h3>5. Paragraph Sprawl</h3>
      <p>One paragraph, one idea. If you find yourself drifting from discussing economic impacts to political history in the same block of text, hit enter. Structure guides the reader through your argument logicially.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
      <p>Fixing these five areas won't just make your paper look better; it will make your arguments land harder. Use tools like Academic Transformer to scan your drafts specifically for these issues before you submit.</p>

        title: "How to Paraphrase Without Plagiarizing",
        excerpt: "The line between paraphrasing and plagiarism can be thin. Learn the 3-step method to rewrite sources safely and effectively.",

      <p>Paraphrasing is more than just swapping synonyms. It's about digesting information and explaining it in your own voice and structure. Many students fall into the "patchwriting" trap—changing a few words but keeping the original sentence structure. This is still plagiarism.</p>
      
      <h3>The 3-Step Method</h3>
      <p><strong>1. Read and Look Away</strong></p>
      <p>Read the original text until you fully understand it. Then, close the book or switch tabs. Do not look at the source while you write.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Explain it to a Friend</strong></p>
      <p>Write down the idea as if you were explaining it to a classmate. This forces you to use simple, natural language and your own sentence structure.</p>
      
      <p><strong>3. Compare and Cite</strong></p>
      <p>Check your version against the original to ensure you haven't accidentally used the same distinct phrases. Finally, add your citation.</p>
